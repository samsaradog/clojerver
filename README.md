# Rails Clojure HTTP Server Handler

These files are part of an exercise to bridge a Rails app with a homegrown HTTP server written in Clojure. More details of the implementation can be found on this [blog post](http://will8light.wordpress.com/2012/12/30/stashing-clues/). 

The http server that goes with this handler is at this [git archive](https://github.com/samsaradog/clojure-http).

## Caveats

This still is not able to retrieve POST data from the client. I'll update the archive once this minor detail gets figured out.

Any suggestions for improvements are more than welcome.

Enjoy!
